### Conflicts of Interest

A conflict of interest may exist whenever the personal interests of a Code of Conduct Team member interfere – or have the appearance that they might potentially interfere – in any way with the interests of the Code of Conduct Team.

A conflict exists when a Code of Conduct Team member takes actions or has business interests that make it difficult to perform their work objectively and effectively. Examples include, but are not limited to:

A financial interest in, business relationship with, or indebtedness to or from a person or entity involved in a matter being considered by the Code of Conduct Team.

Receipt of payments, loans, services, or gifts from a person or entity involved in a matter being considered by the Code of Conduct Team.

A family member receiving an improper personal benefit as a result of the person’s position in the Code of Conduct Team.

A business or personal relationship with another member of the Code of Conduct Team or other involved entity that might interfere with either person’s ability to perform their work objectively and effectively.

Members shall not disclose or use confidential information gained through their work on the CWG for personal or professional profit or advantage.

In the event that a Code of Conduct Team member becomes aware that they may have a conflict of interest, they shall immediately disclose such information to the group as a whole. Such disclosure shall be reflected in the minutes of the meeting, but the details of the disclosure will be held in confidence unless the person making the disclosure and a majority of the other members of the group agree it is in the Code of Conduct Team's best interest to do so.

After disclosure of the potential conflict of interest and all material facts, the member with the potential conflict of interest shall leave the meeting while the remaining members discuss and vote on whether a conflict of interest exists, and whether the member is required to recuse themselves from the issue in question.

A Code of Conduct Team member who has concerns that another member may have a conflict of interest may choose to discuss it individually with the member in question or the group as a whole at their discretion. Any member may recuse themselves at any time from involvement in any decision or discussion in which they believe they have or may have a conflict of interest, without going through the process for determining whether a conflict of interest exists.

A recused member shall not participate in the group’s discussion of the matter or decisions relating to it except to disclose material facts and to respond to questions. A recused member shall not attempt to exert their personal influence with respect to the matter, either at or outside the meeting. If a member would like to comment publicly on a matter from which they are recused, they shall solicit the advice of the non-recused members of the group before doing so. A recused member will still have access to Code of Conduct Team documentation regarding the matter in question unless a majority of the other members of the group decide otherwise.

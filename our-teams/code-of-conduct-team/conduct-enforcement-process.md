### Conflict Resolution vs Conduct Enforcement

It is likely that the Code of Conduct Team will be alerted to incidents that are related to either conflicts of opinion that need help resolving, behaviors that break the Code of Coduct or even occasions where a conflict of opinion leads to one or more of the parties exhibiting behaviors that break the Code of Conduct.

Having conflict of opinion is a healthy component of a community of practice as it is part of how we learn from each other and build the best results. However, there is always a risk that either a conflict of opinion cannot be resolved by the parties or that it leads to behaviors that break the Code of Conduct.

Where a conflict of opinion cannot be resolved by the parties, the Code of Conduct Team can assist by helping them find tools to help find a resolution or even providing arbitration, with the final say being made by the Governance Committee. However, it is not the core purpose of the team.

### Standard Issue Process

Of course, each incident brings a unique set of circumstances that require small adjustments to the process implemented but we should always strive to stick closely to the process below as possible, ensuring that we always work as a team not as individuals and document everything.

1. If the incident has been reported whilst at an in-person event, ensure that the participant reporting the incident is in a safe place. Do not leave them alone unless they are asked to be left alone (and always respect their decision as to their own safety - never think you know better than they do)
2. Alert the rest of the Code of Conduct Team to the incident
3. Assign two members of the team to manage the incident, one lead and one secondary. The members should be chosen based upon the incident and the actors involved; consider gender, friendship with actors involved, etc
4. Log it into the Master Incident log
5. Determine the level of risk we are facing, using the “Likelihood of re-occurence without intervention” and “impact of the incident” tools in the Master Incident Log
6. Open an Incident Diary document shared with the rest of the team
7. Ask for more information from the person reporting the incident. Listen to what they have to say. Actively listening to their concerns is the most important thing at this stage. Do not try to defend or explain the situation, just take down notes and add them to the diary document opened above.
8. Discuss again with the team what would be the next move. Consider the scope of the code as defined above and the worked examples of issues.
9. Take whatever action is appropriate and agreed across the team. Remember to record in the diary.
10. Report back to the team.
11. If appropriate, report back to the wider community. Consider using expertise in the wider GovStack community leadership to formulate any messages.

### Master Incident Log

The Master Incident Log contains a summary of each individual incident so that we can refer to past incidents and identify patterns.

The log must always remain private, accessible only to members of the team, but contains the following columns:

| Issue Reporter | Issue About | Conduct Enforcement or Conflict Resolution | Summary                         | Impact \* Likelihood of Recurrence = risk | Team Lead | Diary Link |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Noah           | Alice       | Conflict                                   | Offensive comments in tech docs | 2 \* 1 = 2                                | Rachel    | xxxx.yyy   |
|                |             |                                            |                                 |                                           |           |            |
|                |             |                                            |                                 |                                           |           |            |

We determine the level of risk we are facing, using the “Likelihood of reccurence” and “impact” tools. If an issue is likely to reccur without intervention AND the impact is medium or high, we know that we must use stronger actions when we intervene.

### Incident Diary

For each incident, we create a new document, only accessible to the current members of the Code of Conduct Team, that records all of the interactions with those involved in the issue, meetings of the team and any decisions and actions taken.

### Worked Examples of Incidents

It is useful for the Code of Conduct Team to have created a series of example incidents which they have worked through before any incidents actually occur.

Whilst it is not possible to cater for every possibility, the worked examples help the team understand how

they would work together to resolve an incident and may give them guidance on common incident types. It is not generally useful to publish all of the example incidents as they may even themselves become a cause for conflict. However, one or two are here for reference:

#### Example Incident 1

Noah emails the Code of Conduct Team alerting them to an inappropriate comment made by Olivia in the specification documents, calling out the poor documentation styles of a particular race.

The two parties are not in the same place physically and no concern for safety is indicated by Noah.

The Code of Conduct Team appoint Robert and Charlie to take a lead on this incident and they contact Noah for more detail. An entry is made in the Indicent Log and an Incident Diary document is opened.

Noah is contacted for more information. Noah reports that the comment appears to be a lone example of its type by Olivia. He is disappointed and saddened by the incident.

Robert and Charlie note the conversation in the Incident Diary

The Code of Conduct Team conact Olivia to inform them that an incident has been raised, explaining the issue. They decide that, as there is not a conflict here, Olivia does not need to be aware who raised the incident at this stage, only what action had caused it to be raised.

The team explain that the Code of Conduct says in the first paragraph that all community members should be able to enjoy a harrassment free experience, regardless of, amongst other things, race. The comment Olivia made makes that not possible.

Olivia expresses her sorrow for making the post.

Robert and Charlie feel that this is a one-off incident and that Olivia is truly sorry for the hurt the comment made. Robert suggests and Olivia agrees to investigate options to get more DEI training so she can be sure not to make the same error again.

Olivia asks about making an apology. Robert points Olivia towards some great resources for making apologies, such as https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/apr/20/how-to-apologize/

Robert and Charlie note the conversation in the Incident Diary and inform the rest of the team.

The team agree that the action taken here is to send an email to Olivia, detailing the incident, impact of the comment, and the parts of the Code of Conduct it infringes. They state that there will be no further action this time but the incident will be recorded for future reference should further incidents be raised.

Noah is informed of the action taken and to expect a public apology from Olivia to be posted. Incident is closed.

# Governance

The GovStack community is managed in a number of teams that collabotate according to the governance model agreed by the Governance Committee.

Each team has a charter, granted by the Governance Committee, describing their responsibilities and the scope of the decisions they make. Where a decision will affect the whole community, they will generally make a recommendation to the Governance Committee for final approval.

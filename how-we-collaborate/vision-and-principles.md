# Vision and Principles

### Our Vision

Our vision is that in five years, we can empower governments to take ownership of their digital futures by building more effective and cost-efficient digital government services.

### Our Principles

#### Neutrality

We will give no priority preference or exclusivity to a specific product or standard. All outputs and working processes will be based on how well it helps us achieve our goal.

#### Generic

All knowledge products will be generic and comprehensive in capturing, as much as possible, all relevant design specifications, and will not be specific to any single products in-market.

#### Open-source

All final deliverables will all be open-source and publicly accessible for reuse and replication by anyone – they will be Digital Public Goods.

#### Standard-based

All knowledge products will capture and be guided by industry-recognized standards -- or reuse those from another sector where a lack of standards exists.

#### Minimalistic

We will focus on the most common functionalities at the lowest maturity level that are required to deliver the minimum capabilities for each Building Block.

#### Agile

We will use quick cycles to develop documentation to test and validate, and then go for the next iteration.

#### Integration

We will ensure a seamless exchange of information across applications and delivered through different channels. Services should be “integrated by design."

#### Citizen-centric

Design will be centered around typical high-priority User Journeys and Use Cases related to the SDGs.
